# PZNS_AgentNate

This is a slightly modified version of the stock NPC AgentWong provided by cow. This NPC will spawn on the player when the game start. This is so as I modify the PZNS framework I can test it via gameplay.

This NPC will spawn with a gun but is equiped with a melee weapon. This is to prevent the NPC firing it's gun, alerted every Zombie in the cell.

Later this may move to being developed into an actual NPC as opposed to a test one.


This is a sample/example project that requires the PZNS Framework.

## The Example should cover the following:
- Creating an NPC without a group
- Setting an NPC's skills.  
- Spawning an NPC via in-game events at a set location.
